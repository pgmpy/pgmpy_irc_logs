<kbd>[05:02:19]</kbd> <code>&lt;navinchandak&gt;</code> me:  Hi ankur You have been looking at a lot of functions which I am not done with During the last commit, I had to push them because I was updating the PEP of some other functions Please don't look at anything whose docstring is not done.. no docstring/PEP means that I am not done with it<br/>
<kbd>[05:02:27]</kbd> <code>&lt;navinchandak&gt;</code> Ankur:  Okay. Then when should I start reviewing the code.<br/>
<kbd>[05:02:38]</kbd> <code>&lt;navinchandak&gt;</code> me:  (I had mentioned this thing in the commit message) You can look at all code whose docstring is done<br/>
<kbd>[05:02:46]</kbd> <code>&lt;navinchandak&gt;</code> Ankur:  Do you understand that its 1800 lines and if I work the way you are suggesting I will have to go over it twice<br/>
<kbd>[05:02:58]</kbd> <code>&lt;navinchandak&gt;</code> me:  I can send you a list of things which you can see Is that fine?  Ankur:  When will you be able to finish the whole PR?<br/>
<kbd>[05:03:10]</kbd> <code>&lt;navinchandak&gt;</code> me:  say tomorrow evening  Ankur:  okay then I will start reviewing the day after tomorrow<br/>
<kbd>[05:03:21]</kbd> <code>&lt;navinchandak&gt;</code> me:  okay fine! Thanks (abinash suggested that when I am working after a PR, then its always advisable to work on a separate branch; I will be doing that from now on) to avoid such problems<br/>
<kbd>[05:03:29]</kbd> <code>&lt;navinchandak&gt;</code> Ankur:  Yeah, working on a different branch for new features would avoid such problems  me:  Yes. Realized that a bit late :/ I will do that next time onwards<br/>
<kbd>[05:03:36]</kbd> <code>&lt;navinchandak&gt;</code> Ankur:  Also I would suggest to have chats on IRC not here.  me:  okay. are you usually online on IRC too, when you are online on GChat?  Ankur:  Yup  me:  okay. I am copying this conversation on IRC<br/>
